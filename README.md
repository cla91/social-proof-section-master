## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried to use grid and flexbox for responsiveness instead of media queries. It wasn't easy.
I added the media queries to adjust some parts like alignment, text and background.
I turned the testimonial part from flexbox to grid in larger screen because I didn't like the wrap of grid in smaller screen (it's like a table), instead using flexbox for the smaller screen the wrapped element is in the center below the other.

### Continued development

I certainly have to practice more and more flexbox and grid. Especially using both of them together.
